# Permutate Framework `1.0.10`

Permutate is a JavaScript/TypeScript and Dart framework to find every possible permutation of an array _(or list in Dart)_ of data.

## Why Permutate?

Permutate allows for seamless and easy use of complex algorithms (like Heap's Algorithm) to find every possible permutation of an array/list. Algorithms like these usually take a general understanding of computer science and mathematical concepts, like recursion and factorials, to recreate. Instead of spending valueble time grasping these conceps, simply create a Permutate instance. That is all it takes.


## Multi Language Integration

Permutate is not limited to single language architecture. It was designed and optimized to work with TypeScript, and Dart. With cohesive imports and fuctionality, Permutate keeps both codebases consistent, allowing for Permutate to remain the same on all languages. 

## Get Started

Ensure that you have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (if using TS) or [Dart](https://dart.dev/) installed.

### Using Permutate with Dart

__1. Add Permutate to Dependancies__

In your `pubspec.yaml` file, add the following to your dependancies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  permutate: ^1.0.10
```

__2. Initiaization__

At the top of your Dart file, import the `permutate` package, as shown:

```dart
import 'package:permutate/dart/permutate.dart';
```

### Using Permutate with TypeScript

__1. Installation with npm__

```
npm i permutate
```

__2. Initiaization__

At the top of your TypeScript file, import `permutate`, as shown:

```ts
import Permutate from "permutate";
```

NOTE: The name Permutate after import is arbitrary; it can be replaced with whatever you'd like and the code will still run properly:

```ts
import Foo from "permutate";
```
