## Why Permutate?

Permutate allows for seamless and easy use of complex algorithms (like Heap's Algorithm) to find every possible permutation of an array/list. Algorithms like these usually take a general understanding of computer science and mathematical concepts, like recursion and factorials, to recreate. Instead of spending valueble time trying to grasp these conceps, all that is needed is Permutate.
